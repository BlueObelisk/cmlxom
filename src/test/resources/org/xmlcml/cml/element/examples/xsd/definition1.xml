    <definition>An enzyme that contains a region to which small, regulatory molecules ('effectors') may bind in addition to and separate from the substrate binding site and thereby affect the catalytic activity.</definition>
    <description>On binding the effector, the catalytic activity of the enzyme towards the substrate may be enhanced, in which case the effector is an activator, or reduced, in which case it is a de-activator or inhibitor.</description>
