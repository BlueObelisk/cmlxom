>In general, an enzyme catalyzes only one
reaction type (reaction selectivity) and operates on only one type
of substrate (substrate selectivity). Substrate molecules are
transformed at the same site (regioselectivity) and only one or
preferentially one of chiral a substrate or of a racemate is
transformed (enantioselectivity[special form of
stereoselectivity]).
