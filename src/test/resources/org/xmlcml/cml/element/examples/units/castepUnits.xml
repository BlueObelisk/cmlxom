	The energy of a photon of frequency f.
    </definition>
    <description>
    The energy of a photon is defined as hf, where h is Planck's constant; therefore, we can use frequency
    as a measure of energy.

    <definition>
	One Kelvin of energy, in this context, is defined as 1K*k_B, the Boltzmann constant.
    </definition>
    <description>
	The Kelvin is a reasonably commonly encountered unit for energy, but the definition can be somewhat
	ambiguous. Here, the energy referred to is simply defined as the product of the magnitude and the 
	Boltzmann constant, which gives the correct dimensionality. Note that this is unrelated to the
	number of particles in the system (i.e., the resulting energy is not per-particle or per-mole);
	thus, a mole of particles with a per-particle energy of 1K/particle (in this terminology) would
	have an energy of 8.314 Jmol-1K-1 (the molar gas constant).
