Trifluoroacetic anhydride (20.7 mL, 147.2 mmol) was added slowly and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was re-cooled to 0°C and saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution was added. After stirring for 30 min, the reaction mixture was acidified with 1N HCl to pH 1, extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was concentrated and the residue was purified with a short silica gel pad (eluted with 5% MeOH in chloroform)to give crude product.
