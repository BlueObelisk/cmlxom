The vessel was purged with nitrogen gas, sealed and heated to 135 °C for 18 hours, after which time it was cooled and the excess triethylamine removed <i>in vacuo.</i> The residue was partitioned between EtOAc/water and extracted. The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, filtered and the solvent removed. The resulting glass was triturated with diethyl ether and filtered to yield N-(2,3-dimethoxybenzyl)-5-{[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]thio}-8-hydroxy-1,6-naphthyridine-7-carboxamide as a solid.<br/>
